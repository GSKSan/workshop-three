# Welcome to Workshop Three!


# Pre-requisites 

Hi all,

This workshop continues where we left off since workshop two. We've also added a few things to this repository to make the session run a bit smoother.

You may notice theres a few extra package dependencies, screens and a new component that we have added.

To make sure everything is set up and ready to go for Friday, please follow these steps (regardless of whether you attended last time or not):
* Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/devsuoa/workshop-three.git`
* `cd` into the 'workshop-three' folder 
* Run `yarn` or `npm install` depending on what package manager you are using 
* Run `expo start` 
* Make sure the app is working correctly on your phone !
